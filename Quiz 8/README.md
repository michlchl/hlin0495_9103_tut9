## QUIZ 8

### *PART 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration*
The images showcase vibrant, eye-catching pattern created through the repetition of stylized fish-like shapes with lively **rainbow colours**. The vibrant color palette with shades of green, blue, purple, orange and pink, adds a sense of playfulness and energetic vibrancy to the overall design. The seamless tiling of the repeating elements across the canvas creates an engaging visual pattern that could potentially be used as a beneficial technique for various design applications. These images could serve as inspiration for projects involving pattern-making, explorations of geometric shapes, and color palettes.

### *PART 2: Coding Technique Exploration*

Perlin noise could potentially be used as a tool or step in the process of creating a similar repeating pattern with smooth colour gradients, which could help achieve the subtle shifts in hue, saturation, and brightness seen in the image, contributing to the overall vibrancy. By combining multiple layers of Perlin noise with different frequencies and amplitudes, complex patterns can be generated, which could then be used as a starting point for creating the repeating tiled design.
